# Simon-Game-JS
Hi ðŸ‘‹!
## Introduction
ðŸŽ® **I implemented The Simon Game as a stepping stone to my journey in learning JavaScript. It is my first ever app made using pure Vanilla JavaScript. It builds on the knowledge I have learned so far. If you haven't heard of Simon Game before, it is a game that involves 4 buttons where the user would have to memorize the pattern of the buttons pressed. If the user gets the pattern, they move on to the next level, and now they have to go through previous pattern, including the new one. If the user presses the wrong button, the game resets to Level 0 ðŸŽ®.**
